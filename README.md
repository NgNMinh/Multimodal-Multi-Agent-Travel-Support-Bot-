# ✈️ Multimodal Multi-Agent Travel Support Bot

A multimodal AI assistant that helps users **search and book flights**, and **reserve airport shuttle services**, powered by a multi-agent architecture built with [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph).

## 💡 Key Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent System**: Uses a Supervisor Agent to coordinate:
  - **Flight Agent** – Searches and books flight tickets.
  - **Shuttle Agent** – Finds and reserves airport shuttle services.
- 🧠 **Multimodal Input**: Supports user input via **text**, **image**, or **audio**.
- 📦 **Real-Time Database Integration**:
  - Fetches available flights and shuttles based on user query.
  - Deducts user balance and stores booking data in **MongoDB** and **SQL**.
- 🔁 **Transactional Booking Flow**: Ensures atomicity between booking and payment.
